# Implementing an event bus

The classes and interfaces from this package can also be used to set up an event bus. The characteristics of an event
bus are:

- It handles *events*, i.e. informational messages
- Zero or more *event subscribers* will be notified of the occurance of an event
- The behavior of the event bus is extensible: *middlewares* are allowed to do things before or after handling an event

## Setting up the event bus

At least we need an instance of `MessageBusSupportingMiddleware`:

```php
use SimpleBus\Message\Bus\Middleware\MessageBusSupportingMiddleware;

$eventBus = new MessageBusSupportingMiddleware();
```

### Finish handling an event, before handling the next

We want to make sure that events are always fully handled before other events will be handled, so we add a
specialized middleware for that:

```php
use SimpleBus\Message\Bus\Middleware\FinishesHandlingMessageBeforeHandlingNext;

$eventBus->appendMiddleware(new FinishesHandlingMessageBeforeHandlingNext());
```

### Defining the event subscriber collection {#event-subscriber-collection}

We want any number of event subscribers to be notified of a given event. We first need to define the collection of event
subscribers that are available in the application. We should make this *event subscriber collection* lazy-loading, or
every event subscriber will be fully loaded, even though it is not going to be used:

```php
use SimpleBus\Message\CallableResolver\CallableCollection;
use SimpleBus\Message\CallableResolver\ServiceLocatorAwareCallableResolver;

// Provide a map of event names to callables. You can provide actual callables, or lazy-loading ones using a ServiceLocator
$eventSubscribersByEventName = [
    Fully\Qualified\Class\Name\Of\Event::class => [
        $fqcn = My\Class\Name::class, // Will use ServiceLocator for instantiation and invoke $instance->notify() if that function exists on the $instance
        $object = new My\Class\Name(), // Will not use ServiceLocator and invoke $object->notify()
        $callable1 = [My\Class\Name::class, 'notify'], // Will not use ServiceLocator and invoke My\Class\Name::notify() statically
        $callable2 = [new My\Class\Name(), 'notify'], // Will not use ServiceLocator and invoke $serviceInstance->notify()
        $callable3 = ['event_subscriber_service_id', 'notify'], // Will use ServiceLocator to instantiate service and invoke '$object->notify()' method
        ['another_event_subscriber_service_id', 'notify']
    ]
];

// Provide a service locator callable. It will be used to instantiate a subscriber service whenever requested.
$serviceLocator = function ($serviceId) {
    $handler = ...;

    return $handler;
};

$eventSubscriberCollection = new CallableCollection(
    $eventSubscribersByEventName,
    new ServiceLocatorAwareCallableResolver($serviceLocator)
);
```

### Resolving the event subscribers for an event

#### The name of an event

First we need a way to resolve the name of an event. You can use the fully-qualified class name (FQCN) of an
event object as its name:

```php
use SimpleBus\Message\Name\ClassBasedNameResolver;

$eventNameResolver = new ClassBasedNameResolver();
```

Or you can ask event objects what their name is:

```php
use SimpleBus\Message\Name\NamedMessageNameResolver;

$eventNameResolver = new NamedMessageNameResolver();
```

In that case your events have to implement `NamedMessage`:

```php
use SimpleBus\Message\Name\NamedMessage;

class YourEvent implements NamedMessage
{
    public static function messageName()
    {
        return 'your_event';
    }
}
```

> #### Implementing your own `MessageNameResolver`
>
> If you want to use another rule to determine the name of an event, create a class that implements
> `SimpleBus\Message\Name\MessageNameResolver`.

### Resolving the event subscribers based on the name of the event

Using the `MessageNameResolver` of your choice, you can now let the *event subscribers resolver* find the right event
subscribers for a given event.

```php
use SimpleBus\Message\Subscriber\Resolver\NameBasedMessageSubscriberResolver;

$eventSubscribersResolver = new NameBasedMessageSubscriberResolver(
    $eventNameResolver,
    $eventSubscriberCollection
);
```

Finally, we should add some middleware to the event bus that notifies all of the resolved event subscribers:

```php
use SimpleBus\Message\Subscriber\NotifiesMessageSubscribersMiddleware;

$eventBus->appendMiddleware(
    new NotifiesMessageSubscribersMiddleware(
        $eventSubscribersResolver
    )
);
```

## Using the event bus: an example

Consider the following event:

```php
class UserRegistered
{
    private $userId;

    public function __construct(UserId $userId)
    {
        $this->userId = $userId;
    }

    public function userId()
    {
        return $this->userId;
    }
}
```

This event conveys the information that "a new user was registered". The message data consists of the unique identifier
of the user that was registered. This information is required for event subscribers to act upon the event.

A subscriber for this event looks like this:

```php
class SendWelcomeMailWhenUserRegistered
{
    ...

    public function notify($message)
    {
        $user = $this->userRepository->byId($message->userId());

        // send the welcome mail
    }
}
```

We should register this subscriber as a service and add the service id to the [event subscriber
collection](#event-subscriber-collection). Since we have already fully configured the event bus, we can just start
creating a new event object and let the event bus handle it. Eventually the event will be passed as a message to the
`SendWelcomeMailWhenUserRegistered` event subscriber:

```php
$userId = $this->userRepository->nextIdentity();

$event = new UserRegistered($userId);

$eventBus->handle($event);
```

> #### Implementing your own event bus middleware
>
> It's very easy to extend the behavior of the event bus. You can create a class that implements
> `MessageBusMiddleware`:
>
> ```php
> use SimpleBus\Message\Bus\Middleware\MessageBusMiddleware;
>
> /**
>  * Marker interface for domain events that should be stored in the event store
>  */
> interface DomainEvent
> {
> }
>
> class StoreDomainEvents implements MessageBusMiddleware
> {
>     ...
>
>     public function handle($message, callable $next)
>     {
>         if ($message instanceof DomainEvent) {
>             // store the domain event
>             $this->eventStore->add($message);
>         }
>
>         // let other middlewares do their job
>         $next($message);
>     }
> }
> ```
>
> You should add an instance of that class as middleware to any `MessageBusSupportingMiddleware` instance (like the
> event bus we created earlier):
>
> ```php
> $eventBus->appendMiddleware(new StoreDomainEvents());
> ```
>
> Make sure that you do this at the right place, before or after you add the other middlewares.
>
> Calling `$next($message)` will make sure that the next middleware in line is able to handle the message.

> #### Logging messages
>
> To log every message that passes through the event bus, add the `LoggingMiddleware` right before the
> `NotifiesMessageSubscribersMiddleware`. Make sure to set up a [PSR-3 compliant
> logger](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3/) first:
>
> ```php
> use Psr\Log\LoggerInterface;
> use Psr\Log\LogLevel;
> use SimpleBus\Message\Logging\LoggingMiddleware;
>
> // $logger is an instance of LoggerInterface
> $logger = ...;
> $loggingMiddleware = new LoggingMiddleware($logger, LogLevel::DEBUG);
> $eventBus->appendMiddleware($loggingMiddleware);
> ```
